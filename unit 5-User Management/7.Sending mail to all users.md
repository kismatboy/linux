Sending an email to all users on a Linux system can be done using various methods, depending on the mail server and email client you have installed. 
**Note:** For this you need to have access to the command line and a working mail server or mail delivery agent (MDA) installed on your system.
### Using mail client

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - Begin by opening a terminal or connecting to your Linux system via SSH.

2. **Compose the Email:**
   - Use the `mail` command to compose your email interactively. Start the `mail` command without any arguments to enter the email composition mode:

     ```bash
     mail
     ```

3. **Compose the Email:**
   - In the email composition mode, you can enter the recipient addresses, subject, and the email message body. To send the email to all users, you can specify `all` as the recipient:

     ```
     To: all
     Subject: Your Subject Here

     Your email message goes here. You can use multiple lines for the message.
     Press Ctrl+D to send the email when you're finished.
     ```

   - Replace `"Your Subject Here"` and the message with your subject and email content.

4. **Send the Email:**
   - After composing the email, press `Ctrl+D` to send it. The `mail` command will send the email to all users.

5. **Exit `mail`:**
   - To exit the `mail` program, you can type `quit` and press Enter.

6. **Check Mailboxes:**
   - Users can check their mailboxes using a mail client like `mutt` or by running the `mail` command to read the received email.


### Using bash scripting

Here are the steps to send an email to all users:

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - Begin by opening a terminal or connecting to your Linux system via SSH.

2. **Compose the Email:**
   - Use a text editor, such as `nano` or `vim`, to compose your email message. For example:

     ```bash
     nano email_message.txt
     ```

   - Write your email message in the text file. Include the subject, body, and any other necessary details.

3. **Send the Email to All Users:**
   - To send the email to all users, you can use a loop in a shell script. Here's an example using a `for` loop:

     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     for user in $(getent passwd | cut -d: -f1); do
         if [ -f "/var/mail/$user" ]; then
             cat email_message.txt | mail -s "Subject" $user
         fi
     done
     ```

     Save this script to a file, for example, `send_to_all.sh`, and make it executable:

     ```bash
     chmod +x send_to_all.sh
     ```

   - Replace `"Subject"` with the subject of your email and `email_message.txt` with the path to your email message file.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to send the email to all users:

     ```bash
     ./send_to_all.sh
     ```

   - The script will loop through all user accounts, check if they have a mailbox (`/var/mail/username`), and send the email.

5. **Monitor Email Sending:**
   - As the script runs, you may see the email client prompt for a message body. You can automate this by piping the message body directly to `mail`, but some configurations may require manual input.

6. **Check Mailboxes:**
   - Users can check their mailboxes using a mail client like `mutt` or by running the `mail` command to read the received email.
