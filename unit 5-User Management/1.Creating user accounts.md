Creating a new user account in a Linux operating system involves several steps, including user creation, specifying user details, setting a password, and configuring user permissions.

**Note:** The following instructions are for systems using the `useradd` and `passwd` commands, which are common in many Linux distributions. Some distributions may use different tools or have graphical user interfaces for user management.

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - To create a new user account, open a terminal on your Linux system. You will need superuser (root) privileges to create a new user.

2. **Create the User:**
   - Use the `useradd` command to create a new user. Replace `new_username` with the desired username.

   ```bash
   sudo useradd new_username
   ```

   This command creates a new user account with default settings. The user's home directory will typically be created in `/home/new_username`.

3. **Set User Details:**
   - You can specify additional user details, such as the user's full name and contact information, using the `useradd` command with the `-c` option.

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -c "Full Name" new_username
   ```

   Replace `"Full Name"` with the user's actual full name.

4. **Set Password:**
   - To set a password for the new user, use the `passwd` command.

   ```bash
   sudo passwd new_username
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter and confirm the user's password. Make sure to choose a strong password.

5. **Assign User to Groups (Optional):**
   - By default, a new user is placed in a group with the same name as the username. You can add the user to additional groups using the `usermod` command.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG groupname new_username
   ```

   Replace `groupname` with the name of the group you want to add the user to.

6. **Verify User Creation:**
   - You can use the `id` command to verify that the user has been created and to check their group memberships.

   ```bash
   id new_username
   ```

7. **Set Home Directory Permissions (Optional):**
   - By default, the user's home directory is created with appropriate permissions. However, if you need to modify permissions or ownership, you can use the `chown` and `chmod` commands.

   ```bash
   sudo chown new_username:new_username /home/new_username
   ```

   This command changes the owner and group of the user's home directory to match the username.

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 700 /home/new_username
   ```

   This command sets strict permissions on the user's home directory, allowing only the user to read, write, and execute files within it.

8. **Log In as the New User:**
   - To test the new user account, you can switch to the user's session using the `su` (substitute user) command.

   ```bash
   su - new_username
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter the user's password.

9. **(Optional) Grant Administrative Privileges (sudo):**
   - If you want the new user to have administrative privileges, you can add them to the `sudo` group. This allows the user to execute commands with superuser privileges using `sudo`.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG sudo new_username
   ```

   This step is optional and should be done with caution. Only grant sudo access to trusted users who need it.

10. **Logout and Log In:**
    - After creating the user account and configuring permissions, it's a good practice to log out and log in as the new user to ensure everything is working as expected.
